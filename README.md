# Jack

Jack is a new language designed by Tim Caswell with the explicit goal of being easy to explain the semantics while still being powerful.

Jack is a scripting language aimed at kids learning to program as well as professionals who yearn for a simpler language (like me).

## Language Features

 - Immutable unicode strings
 - Mutable Binary buffers (fixed length)
 - Booleans
 - Null
 - Integers
 - Floating Point Numbers
 - First class and higher-order functions.
   - Lexical closure.
 - Basic key/value maps for objects (no inheritance or prototype chain)
 - Dense Arrays
 - Everything is an expression where possible.
 - Implicit return values
 - Unified looping syntax that works on objects, arrays, and generator functions
 - Object metamethods for advanced usage (get, set, keys, length, call)
   - Allows objects to act like functions, arrays, etc.

My guiding principle while adding language features and semantics is:

> Keep it Simple, Keep it Safe

See the examples folder for syntax examples.
